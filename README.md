# KFAboutWindow
An about window displaying Credits from RTF and Acknowledgements from Cocoapods´ generated plist file.

This is an about window similar to Xcode's. Additionally it can handle CocoaPods Acknowledgements.plist – with one button click you have an auto scrolling list of all used Pods and their licences. You only have to copy the plist generated by Cocoapods in a [post\_install\_hook](http://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#post_install) and add it to your target.
